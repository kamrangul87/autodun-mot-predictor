    <p><a href="index.html">← Back to MOT Predictor</a></p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      This tool estimates the probability that a vehicle will pass its next MOT
      test. It is designed as an early warning and decision-support tool, not as
      a replacement for a professional inspection.
    </p>

    <h2>Current Model (v1)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Model type: Logistic regression</li>
      <li>Features used:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Vehicle age</strong> (years since first registration)</li>
          <li><strong>Mileage</strong> (current odometer reading)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Training data: DVSA-style MOT samples (pass/fail outcomes)</li>
      <li>Deployment: JSON model on GitHub → API on Vercel</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How the Probability Is Calculated</h2>
    <p>
      The model computes a score
      <code>z = w_age * vehicle_age + w_mileage * mileage + intercept</code>,
      then converts this into a probability using the logistic function:
    </p>

    <pre>
probability = 1 / (1 + exp(-z))
    </pre>

    <p>
      The current parameters are stored in
      <code>ml/models/mot_model_v1.json</code>.
      For example:
    </p>

    <pre>
{
  "coef": [[-0.25, -0.00001]],
  "intercept": [3.0],
  "columns": ["vehicle_age", "mileage"]
}
    </pre>

    <h2>Risk Bands</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>High risk</strong>: probability &lt; 50%</li>
      <li><strong>Medium risk</strong>: 50% – 70%</li>
      <li><strong>Low risk</strong>: probability ≥ 70%</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      These thresholds can be adjusted as more data is added or different
      calibration targets are required.
    </p>

    <h2>Limitations & Disclaimer</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The current model only uses age and mileage. Other factors such as
        previous failures, servicing history, and vehicle type are not yet
        included.
      </li>
      <li>
        The prediction is a statistical estimate and cannot guarantee an MOT
        outcome for any individual vehicle.
      </li>
      <li>
        This tool is for information and experimentation purposes and should not
        be used as the sole basis for financial or safety decisions.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Roadmap</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Ingest larger DVSA datasets for training.</li>
      <li>
        Add more features (fuel type, body type, previous MOT history, test
        station).
      </li>
      <li>Model comparison dashboard and calibration plots.</li>
      <li>
        Integration with the main Autodun platform (EV Finder, MOT history,
        etc.).
      </li>
    </ul>
